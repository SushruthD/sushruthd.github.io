    <h1>JUNIOR RESEARCH FELLOW</h1>
    <h2>DEVELOPMENT OF NANO-POLISHING TECHNOLOGY FOR ALUMINIUM MIRRORS</h2>
    <h3>ISRO - SAC | MAY 2022 - AUGUST 2023</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed nano-polishing technology to significantly improve the surface quality of aluminum mirrors. <br></li>
        <li>Created a robot-assisted polishing technology to achieve high-precision finishing of metal mirrors. <br></li>
        <li>Led the development of a superfinishing process for ultra-smooth surfaces. <br></li>
        <li>Integrated software simulation, PLC control, and HMI for enhanced process automation. <br></li>
        <li>Designed, prototyped, and analyzed components using Ansys and CAE simulation software. <br></li>
        <li>Pioneered an interferometric technique for advanced surface characterization. <br></li>
        <li>Led the development of interferometric techniques for characterizing space mirror surfaces. <br></li>
        <li>Designed experiments to optimize polishing processes. Assess surface on (CMM) Coordinate Measuring Machine. <br></li>
        </ul>
